# fuzzycron
![master build](https://github.com/oofoghlu/fuzzycron/actions/workflows/validation.yaml/badge.svg)

Boost your Kubernetes CronJobs with Jenkins-style hashed cron expressions.

fuzzycron provides a FuzzyCronJob CRD that manages CronJobs in your cluster, effectively extending
CronJobs to handle hashes in cron expressions.

fuzzycron runs as an operator in your cluster, evaluating the hash expressions, and creating CronJob
resources from the evaluated expression. These hashes allow for more uniform distribution of your workloads
across time. Like with Jenkins, the hashes are deterministic on a per-job basis, meaning changes to the Spec
won't affect your workloads already running.

A ValidatingWebhook is provided to ensure the hash expression and cron specs are validated.

## Description

A FuzzyCronJob contains an embedded CronJob spec. This spec is identical to the standard CronJob spec with schedule excluded. The CronJob
inherits labels and annotations from the FuzzyCronJob.

Sample manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch.oofoghlu/v1
kind: FuzzyCronJob
metadata:
  name: fuzzycronjob-sample
spec:
  schedule: "H H * * *"
  cronJob:
    startingDeadlineSeconds: 60
    concurrencyPolicy: Allow
    jobTemplate:
      spec:
        template:
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: hello
              image: busybox
              args:
              - /bin/sh
              - -c
              - date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster
            restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Will be evaluated as:

```
$ kubectl get fcj
NAME                  FUZZY SCHEDULE   SCHEDULE
fuzzycronjob-sample   H H * * *        46 21 * * *

$ kubectl get cj
NAME                  SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
fuzzycronjob-sample   46 21 * * *   False     0        119m            122m
```

The hash is based on `<namespace>-<name>` allowing for crons with the same name to be scheduled differently across
namespaces, or more simply for all crons that need to run on the same cadence are spread out. The hash is evaluated
differently per field index in the cron expression ensuring spread from field to field when evaluated for the same
range.

Some sample expressions supported (along with example evaluations):

```
H H H H H
-> 20 19 11 6 4

H H * H/2 *
-> 18 17 * 1/2 *

H(5-15)/20 H/5 * * *
-> 12/20 3/5 * * *

H(0-5) * * * *
-> 4 * * * *
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.20.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/fuzzycron:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/fuzzycron:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```
